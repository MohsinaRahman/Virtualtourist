# Virtualtourist
Built an app that gives the users the ability to store and retrieve location data/pictures/site information from popular pages. The stored data can be retrieved even without internet connection. For example, Flickr was used to download and store images based on a dropped pin location 
# App functionalities
### MapViewController
A user can drop pins around the world. As soon as a pin is dropped photo data for the pin location is fetched from Flickr. The actual photo downloads occur in the CollectionViewController. A user can also select the pic as well as delete the pin
